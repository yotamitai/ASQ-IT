## Dependencies:

The example implementation for the highway domain requires the following repositories:

*  [highway-env - v1.4](https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env/tree/v1.4)

*  [rl-agents](https://github.com/eleurent/rl-agents) - **IMPORTANT** this repository has been updated and no longer works as desired. To overcome this please install the following older version using:

`pip install git+https://github.com/eleurent/rl-agents.git@d55126007fcc5d2a882843f6c3a63000b4fc7c92`

**Notice: After installing rl-agents you'll need to downgrade gym to the required version (0.19)**

* pandas < 2.0
* numpy <= 1.21.5
